# tictac

A simple tictactoe game i wrote in c to learn what can be done.

You can build using `make` in your terminal and run `./tictac` from within the folder.

Alternatively you can run `make` then `make clean install`, this will place tictac in your ~/.local/bin dir and will allow you to run `tictac` in your terminal.
